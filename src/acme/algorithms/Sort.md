**Bubble sort**

* Time complexity: O(n ^ 2), O of n ^ 2
* Space complexity: In-place algorithm
* Stable sort algorithm (guarantees to preserve ordering of relative duplicate items)
* Divides an array into sorted and unsorted partitions

---

**Selection sort**

* Time complexity: O(n ^ 2), O of n ^ 2
* Space complexity: In-place algorithm
* Does not require as much swapping as bubble sort (hence considered generally more efficient than bubble sort, however selection sort is unstable sort algorithm compared to bubble sort)
* Unstable sort algorithm (does not guarantee to preserve ordering of relative duplicate items)
* Divides an array into sorted and unsorted partitions

**Insertion sort**

* Time complexity: O(n ^ 2), O of n ^ 2
* Space complexity: In-place algorithm
* Stable sort algorithm (guarantees to preserve ordering of relative duplicate items)
* Divides an array into sorted and unsorted partitions
